  <p class="red">
    With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are
    positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
    different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

  <div class="tip">
    <span class="orange">Tip:</span> The word <span class="orange">cascading</span> means that a style applied to a
    parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text
    to "blue," all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless
    you specify something else)!
